Products.ATCustomizableView Package Readme
==========================================

Overview
--------

A simple Plone monkey patch to enhance a little the basic Plone control hover the view of content types.

Accessing and applying a simple Zope boolean property (fixed_layout) to content types can block the
user ability to change layouts on a single document/folder.

This can be very useful on simpler sites. You can also set a (non standard?) view to a single
content and make the user not able to change your choice.

The final effect is to disable completly the "view" dropdown menu.

This products has been written related to a `tutorial on Plone.it`__ (italian language!).
